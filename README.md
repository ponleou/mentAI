### The Mental Health Tracker with AI
The mentAI project is aim to aid the global issue of mental health and well being. Our purpose is to develop a mental health tracker to diagnose user’s mental health, which can be used as a helping tool for users to track and improve their mental health. Our project plans to use computer vision for detecting facial expression and a chatbot to question and diagnose the user.

### Our Problem Statements:
- **Mental Health Issues all time High:** There has been a significant increase in mental health issues and suicide rates in the last decade
- **Stigma Surrounding Mental Health:** Stigma and misconceptions about mental illness persist, preventing individuals from seeking help and leading to discrimination and social exclusion.
- **Treatment Barriers and Shortage:** Barriers such as cost, language barriers, lack of awareness, and availability of resources hinder access to mental health treatment and support services.
